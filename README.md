# landing_page

For this project, I'll be creating an entire web page from a design provided by TOP. The designs come in the form of two images - one of the complete website, and one with details about fonts and colours used on the web page. 

Skills I'll be practising:
-Git, GitHub (writing commit messages, commits, etc)
-HTML (setting up structure of web page)
-CSS (styling, specificity rules)
-Flexbox (alignment)
